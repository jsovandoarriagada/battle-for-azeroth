💡 This was one of the first personal projects since I began studying HTML & CSS on my own, and one of the first final project ideas for the Coderhouse's Web Development course. It's a landing page about Blizzard's World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth.

👉 It has the following characteristics:
1️⃣ Layout → Grid.
2️⃣ Components → Flexbox.
3️⃣ Designed for 1080p.
4️⃣ Non-responsive.
